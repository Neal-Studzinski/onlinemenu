Describe your application here and what it does

Create a website for a fictional restaurant that allows customers to place orders online.

Display the menu by using the provided api (see Notes section)

A customer should be able to add an item to their order by clicking on the item's name in the menu. Alternatively, you can create a button on each menu item that says "add to order"

Display the total for the customer, and include tax at 8%.

When the customer clicks the order now button, you should save their order to a tiny-za-server endpoint

After submitting their order the customer should be taken to a confirmation screen displaying their order and the total due (no wireframe provided).

NOTES
Before you begin coding, you must plan out your models, views, and actions.

Include:
What models do you need and what data do they hold?
What custom functions does each model need to be presented?
How many views will you need?
what events does each view listen to?
How many Actions will you have in your app?
What data will each Action be dispatched with?

Wireframe suggestion
You will be using the webpack starter for this assignment, go re-clone it
Once you get the webpack starter working, I highly recommend using the redux todo app as a reference to make sure you've got your reducer and render function working properly.
Menu api endpoints (pick your favorite, or be adventurous and use them all):
Fancy menu: https://tiy-austin-front-end-engineering.github.io/restaurantApi/fancy.json
Cafe menu: https://tiy-austin-front-end-engineering.github.io/restaurantApi/cafe.json
Pub menu: https://tiy-austin-front-end-engineering.github.io/restaurantApi/pub.json
The Noun Project has cool icons you can use as logos if you're looking to take a break from coding
